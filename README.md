# BookAPI
.Net Core 6.0 API with Dependency Injection. API has endpoints that allow you to do all CRUD operations.

In .Net Core 6.0, you no longer has a Startup.cs file in the root with Program.cs unlike .Net Core 5.0. 
Essentially all of the logic from the Startup.cs file is moved into the Program.cs file in .Net Core 6.0.
